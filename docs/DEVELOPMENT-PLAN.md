# Lockb0x Codex Forge — Development Plan

## Comprehensive Improvement Plan (2025-10-20)

### File Upload & Payload Storage
- Add support for binary file uploads (use readAsArrayBuffer for non-text files)
- Ensure storage.location always references the actual uploaded payload file
- Add UI link/button to download the payload from Drive
- Prevent overwriting payload file when uploading Codex entry

### Error Handling & UI Feedback
- Improve error messages in the UI for upload/auth failures
- Display clear instructions for recovery (e.g., re-authenticate, retry upload)
- Show status and error messages for all user actions

### Google Auth Token Persistence
- Persist Google auth token in chrome.storage for session reliability
- Always check token validity before making API calls

### Workflow & Reference Consistency
- Ensure artifact field and storage.location are consistent and valid
- Document workflow and expected results for users and testers

### Schema Validation & Export
- Validate that payload file exists and Drive link is valid before export
- Display validation results and errors in popup

### Testing & QA
- Add unit tests for binary file uploads, payload storage, and anchor logic
- Expand tests for Google anchor integration and edge cases
- Test end-to-end flows for all anchor types and export scenarios

### Documentation & Contributor Guide
- Update README and docs with troubleshooting, usage, and contribution guidelines
- Document Google anchor integration and schema validation flow
- Add verification instructions and sample scripts for users

### Roadmap Summary
- Complete all improvements above for robust, user-friendly release
- Finalize for hackathon/demo/production submission

## Hackathon Submission Strategy
- Overhaul documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md, GoogleCloudAnchor.md)
- Create demo assets (screenshots, GIFs, video walkthrough)
- Summarize user feedback and testing
- Complete competitive analysis
- Draft future roadmap
- Prepare submission checklist for judges

## Unified Implementation Checklist
 [x] File upload & payload storage improvements
 [ ] Error handling & UI feedback enhancements
 [x] Google auth token persistence

## Technical Milestones
- Complete Google anchor API integration (see GoogleCloudAnchor.md)
- Improve error handling and UI feedback
- Expand AI metadata capabilities
- Enhance schema validation and compliance checks
- Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission

## Team Assignments
Refer to AGENTS.md for current roles and responsibilities. Assign each hackathon deliverable to a specific agent or contributor.

## Progress Tracking
Update this checklist and milestone status regularly to ensure alignment and readiness for hackathon submission.

🚀 Codex Forge: AI-Assisted Lockb0x Entry Creator — Development Plan
Project Goal:
A Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) for creating valid Lockb0x Codex Entries (v0.0.2) from web content or user-uploaded files, using Chrome's built-in AI for automated metadata generation and supporting both mock and Google anchor flows.

Current Build Status (as of 2025-10-14)
Protocol Core (mock anchor, signing): ✅ Complete
AI Metadata Integration: ✅ Complete
Google Anchor Integration: 🟡 In Progress (adapter stubbed, UI/auth logic present; UI feedback and error handling improved)
Schema Validation & Export Polish: ✅ Complete (validation runs before export, feedback shown in popup)
Unit Testing: ✅ Complete (protocol, AI, and validation modules covered)

Architecture Overview
Component	File Path(s)	Role/Functionality
Manifest	manifest.json	Declares service worker, popup, permissions
Service Worker	background.js	Protocol engine, message handling, entry generation
Protocol Logic	protocol.js	UUID, hashing, canonicalization, signing, anchor logic
AI Integration	ai.js	Chrome AI APIs for summarization, tagging, certificate
Schema Validation	lib/validate.js, codex-entry.json	Validates entries before export
Popup UI	popup/popup.html, popup.js	User interface, file/page input, anchor selection, export
Unit Tests	lib/*.test.js	Jest tests for protocol, AI, validation

Completed Features
Manifest V3 setup with all required permissions
Protocol core: UUID, SHA-256, ni-URI, canonicalization, signing
Mock anchor and Google anchor selection (Google adapter stubbed)
Chrome AI metadata generation (summarization, process tag, certificate summary)
Schema validation before export, with feedback in popup
Robust error handling and UI feedback for all user actions
Unit tests for protocol, AI, and validation modules

Remaining Development Tasks
1. Google Anchor Integration (Production)
Implement real Google anchor API integration in protocol.js (replace stub)
Use Google Drive or Cloud APIs to create and verify anchors
Handle token refresh, error states, and user feedback
Update documentation for Google anchor production flow
2. Edge Case & Anchor Testing
Expand unit tests for anchor logic, including error and edge cases
Add tests for Google anchor integration once implemented
3. AI API Fallbacks & Robustness
Ensure Chrome AI APIs are available and handle fallback gracefully
Add error feedback if AI APIs fail or are unavailable
4. Documentation & Contributor Guide
Update README and docs with latest troubleshooting, usage, and contribution guidelines
Document Google anchor integration and schema validation flow
5. Final Polish & QA
Test end-to-end flows for all anchor types and export scenarios
Review UI/UX for clarity and accessibility
Finalize for hackathon/demo/production submission

Roadmap Summary
Google Anchor Integration: Production-ready API calls, error handling, and documentation
Testing: Expand anchor and edge case coverage
AI Robustness: Fallbacks and user feedback for AI failures
Docs & Polish: Final documentation, contributor guide, and QA
Lockb0x Codex Forge is nearly feature-complete. The final milestone is production-grade Google anchor integration and comprehensive testing/documentation for a robust, user-friendly release.
