# Lockb0x Codex Forge — Chrome Extension

## Overview
Lockb0x Codex Forge is a Chrome Extension that streamlines the creation of secure, verifiable Lockb0x Codex Entries (v0.0.2) from web content or user-uploaded files. It leverages Chrome's built-in AI for automated metadata generation and supports both mock and Google anchor flows for robust protocol compliance.

## Comprehensive Improvement Plan (2025-10-20)
- Binary file upload support for all payloads
- Reliable Google auth token persistence
- Improved error handling and UI feedback
- Consistent workflow and file references
- Download link for payload files
- Enhanced schema validation and export polish
- Expanded unit tests for anchor, payload, and edge cases
- Updated documentation and contributor guides

## Workflow & Features
1. **Upload File or Extract Page Content:** Select a file (text, PDF, JSON, etc.) or extract content from the current web page.
2. **Anchor Selection:** Choose between mock or Google anchor. Sign in with Google for Drive integration.
3. **Payload Storage:** Uploaded files are stored in Google Drive (for Google anchor) and referenced in the Codex entry.
4. **Codex Entry Generation:** The extension hashes, canonicalizes, signs, and anchors your entry, using AI to generate metadata.
5. **Export & Verification:** Download the Codex entry, copy to clipboard, and verify schema/signature in the popup. Download the original payload from Drive.

## Verification Instructions
- Download the payload from the Drive link in the Codex entry
- Compute SHA-256 hash and compare to integrity_proof
- Confirm anchor file exists and matches metadata
- Validate ES256 signature using the JWK in kid
- Use provided verification script or tool for automated checks

## Roadmap & Hackathon Readiness

- Google anchor integration is in progress (adapter stubbed, UI/auth logic present; UI feedback and error handling improved).
- Schema validation and export polish are implemented and working in the popup.
- Unit testing for protocol, AI, and validation modules is implemented.

## Troubleshooting & Error Handling
### Common Issues
- **Unchecked runtime.lastError: Cannot access a chrome:// URL**
	- This occurs if you try to extract content from a Chrome internal page (chrome://). Only extract from regular web pages.
- **Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module**
	- Ensure popup.js is loaded with `<script type="module">` in popup.html. All imports should use correct relative paths.
- **Google Sign-In Not Working**
	- Make sure you have the "identity" permission in manifest.json and are signed into Chrome with a Google account.
- **Service Worker Registration Failed**
	- Confirm that background.js is declared as a module in manifest.json (`type: "module"`).

### Debugging Tips
- Use Chrome DevTools (F12) on the popup and background pages for console logs and error messages.
- Check the extension's background page for logs and errors in chrome://extensions > Details > Inspect views.
- Review status and error messages in the popup UI for feedback on user actions.
- For anchor and signing errors, see the console logs in background.js for detailed error traces.
